## Temporary Solution (For Testing)

### Option 1: Use Existing Images
If you have ANY blade/machinery photos available, place them in the products folder with the correct filenames. Even lower quality images work for initial testing.

### Option 2: Placeholder Images (Currently Used)
The demo page currently uses placeholder paths. The page will display broken image icons until real images are provided, but the layout and functionality will work.

### Option 3: Generic Stock Images
You can temporarily use generic industrial/machinery stock images from:
- Unsplash.com (search: "industrial blades", "cutting tools", "machinery")
- Pexels.com (search: "industrial equipment", "metal cutting")

Download and rename to match the required filenames above.

## Image Preparation Tips

### Taking Photos Yourself
1. **Use good lighting** - Natural daylight or bright workshop lights
2. **Clean the product** - Remove dust, oil, fingerprints
3. **Plain background** - White paper, light wall, or clean workbench
4. **Multiple angles** - Take 10-20 photos, choose the best ones
5. **Include scale reference** - Put a ruler or coin next to the blade for size reference

### Using Existing Photos
1. **Crop to focus** - Remove unnecessary background
2. **Adjust brightness** - Make sure the product is clearly visible
3. **Convert to WebP** - Use online tools like Squoosh.app to compress and convert

### Professional Photography (Later)
Once the website is live and working, you can hire a photographer to take professional product photos. For now, any clear photo is better than no photo!
