## 📝 Notes & Tips

### Writing Product Descriptions Tips
```
Formula: Problem → Solution → Benefits → Call-to-Action

Example:
"[Problem] Industrial cutting operations demand blades that withstand
severe wear while maintaining edge precision. [Solution] Our alloy blades
combine high-grade tool steel with advanced heat treatment. [Benefits] This
delivers 3x longer service life and consistent cut quality. [CTA] Contact
us for custom specifications."
```

### Naming Conventions Best Practices
```
✓ DO: Use descriptive names (alloy-blades, tissue-paper-blades)
✓ DO: Use hyphens for spaces (large-rotary-blades)
✓ DO: Keep it short and clear
✗ DON'T: Use generic names (product-1, blade-type-a)
✗ DON'T: Use Chinese pinyin (heijindaopian)
✗ DON'T: Use special characters or spaces
```
